Subject: [PATCH] Fedora: Set grub boot-flags on shutdown / reboot

Fedora's grub will automatically hide the boot-menu if the previous
boot has set the boot_success flag in grub's environment. This happens
automatically 30 seconds after login.

But if the user shuts down or reboots from the system-menu before then
(e.g. directly from gdm) then the boot_success flag gets not set. If
a reboot / shutdown is initiated through gnome-session then the user
is successfully interacting with the system, so set the boot_success
flag from gnome_session for this case to fix reboot from gdm leading to
the boot-menu not being hidden.
